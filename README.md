# Proxy-List-Creator
A simple tool made to store/save/archive different school proxy unblockers.

Made to be practical.

It comes with 3 containers for you to hold specific types of proxies in, and an automatic URL authenticity/activity checker (doesn't work on rammerhead urls) and then saves the urls using a single json file.

Compatible with Glitch
